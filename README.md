# Testing-genetic-and-evolutionary-algorithms

Project created to study and test genetic and evolutionary algorithms through a racing game with checkpoints.

To train the model:
```
Run src/test/java/ver3_0/SkeletonMainEvolutivo.java 
```

To test the model:
```
Run src/test/java/ver3_0/SkeletonMainComprobarEvolutivo.java 
```

# Teaser
Here you can see a video of the program with a trained model running.
